# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is the beginning of my coding journey! You will find important notes for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Aswell as a randomizer inside the developer console to help decide what topic to study for the day. While working on this project I learned that HTML sets the structure and layout of a website. CSS is a language that helps developers style their website. Git allows developers to make changes to their code while maintaining a stable base branch and then push those changes through once they are satisfied. Finaly JavaScript is responsible for a websites interactivity with the end user.
